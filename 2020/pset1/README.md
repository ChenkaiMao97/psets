# Problem set 1

**This problem set is due Mon Feb 24 at 11:59pm EST. Please submit your write-up and code. When you write up your report, put all writing into one file and name it ${mit_email_username}.pdf (e.g. iychen.pdf). Please note any and all collaborators. You may not share code or write-ups with anyone.**

We are interested in predicting ICU mortality from clinical records.

By now, you should have access to the [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/) dataset and to Physionet worksplace. If you do not, please refer to Problem Set 0. If you still have problems with access to the data, please contact the course staff through Piazza. 

The MIMIC-III database is 40-50 GB, so although all data comes from MIMIC-III, we have parsed it for your convenience. We will be using Google Colab for this Pset (essentially an IPython notebook in the cloud), since Physionet has made it possible to query MIMIC via Google Cloud. Setup instructions for that are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s2EQ3QVe2iFhcKb-tMMxYQaFJf86O6NVIGcGBAflYOA/edit?usp=sharing).
